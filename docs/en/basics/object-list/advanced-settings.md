# Advanced Settings

Many parameters concerning the [object lists](./index.md) can be adapted according to your requirements. This increases clarity and provides the possibility to gain access to desired contents quickly.

Adapting the Number of Objects per Page
---------------------------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
You have the possibility to define the number of displayed [objects](../../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) per page for the system. This is a custom setting so that all users are able to determine the objects per page for their own view individially. You can enter and set the number with **`Administration → User settings → System settings`**. A very high value may reduce performance.

Maximum Length of Object Titles
-------------------------------

Depending on how many attributes or columns are to be displayed in a list, it may be useful to limit the maximum length of the object title. Should an [object title](../unique-references.md) exceed this length, it will be abbreviated with three dots (...) from the specified length. You can adapt the maximum length with **Administration** **→** **System settings** **→** **Tenant settings** **"[TENANTNAME]" →** **Maximum length → **Object title in lists****. Enter the desired maximum length as a positive integer into the text field.

Activation/ Deactivation of the Quickpurge Button
-------------------------------------------------

You can add the [**Quickpurge**](../life-and-documentation-cycle.md) button to the action bar in object lists. With **Administration** **→** **System settings →** **System-wide →** **Activate quickpurge button** you can either select **Yes** to display the button or **No** so that it isn't shown.

Activation/ Deactivation of the Drag and Drop Function
------------------------------------------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
An object can be assigned to another [object type](../../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) by using the drag and drop function. With **`` `**Administration **`→ CMDB settings → General configuration → **Drag 'n' Drop of objects**``**  you can either activate the function by choosing **`Yes`** or deactivate it by choosing **`No`**.

Display of Templates in Object Lists

Templates aren't displayed in object lists in i-doit. However, you can display them beside Norma, Archived and Deleted as templates. Use **Administration** **→ CMDB settings → General configuration → **Template Configuration → Show t**emplate filter in object lists** to carry out the corresponding settings.
