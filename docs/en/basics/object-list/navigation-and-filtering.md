It's no big deal to navigate through an [object list](/display/en/Object+List) and search for specific [objects](/display/en/Structure+of+the+IT+Documentation). And yet it's worth taking a closer look.

Navigation
----------

Longer object lists are distributed over several pages through which you can navigate specifically. With the ... button you can enter a particular page.

For each user you can determine [how many objects per page](/display/en/Advanced+Settings) you want to display. Additionally, you can skip this setting via a drop-down menu and thus display 50, 100 or even all objects on one page.

Keyboard commands

You can operate the object list with your keyboard with the following commands:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **`Down`** | Jump to the next line |
| `**Up**` | Jump to the previous line |
| `**Space key  <br>**` | Select an object, i.e. select the respective checkbox |
| `**Shift+space key  <br>**` | Select an area of objects |

You can also use the shift key in combination with the left mouse button to select an area of objects.

Filtering
---------

You can filter the lines of an object list by attributes. One of the displayed attributes is intended for the [default filter](/display/en/Configuration+of+the+List+View). You can start filtering directly; search suggestions are generated when you enter **at** **least 3 characters**. When you select one of these suggestions, the object is loaded directly instead of filtering the list.

Additionally, you can filter for several attributes simultaneously via drop-down menu (And-operation). Confirm the filter by clicking the `**Filter**` button. The selected filter is also displayed in a text bar. You can reset the filter with the respective button.

You can [pre-filter](/display/en/Configuration+of+the+List+View) the object list already during loading.
