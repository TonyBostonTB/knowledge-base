# Administration

If you want to take advantage of each and every subtlety a perfect [IT documentation](../../glossary.md) can offer, then you will need to deal with the administration of _i-doit_ in greater detail. Most administrative actions can be managed via the web GUI.

## Where Can I Find the Administration?

The administration is accessed via the gear wheel icon in the top right corner. The user area is diplayed as soon as you hover over you login name with the mouse.
