Object-matching Profiles
------------------------

The [object-matching profiles](../../consolidate-data/object-identification-during-imports.md) were created to determine criteria to be used when you want to establish a connection between an external object and an i-doit object via an interface. You can define how many and which attributes have to comply for a successful matching.
