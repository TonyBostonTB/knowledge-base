Which IT components are available for which staff member and where can I find them? To ensure that you always have a good overview with regard to this question, you can document IT workplaces in i-doit.

Persons and their Workplaces
----------------------------

Besides the physical assignement of [objects](/display/en/Structure+of+the+IT+Documentation) to [locations](/display/en/Locations), workplaces can be documented as logical construct. The **`Workplace`** [object type](/display/en/Structure+of+the+IT+Documentation) plays a central role.

An object of this type is assigned to a person via the `**Logical Location**` [category](/display/en/Structure+of+the+IT+Documentation).

Conversely, this person is assigned to one or more workplaces via the **`Persons`** object in the `**Assigned Workplaces**` category.

IT Components at the Workplace
------------------------------

The assignment of any (IT) components to a workplace is carried out in the `**Workplace components**` category within the `**Workplace**` object.

A workplace component can only be assigned to one workplace. You can search for the specific workplace of a component within the category `**Assigned workstation**` in the **`Workplace components`** object.

Location of a Workplace
-----------------------

Last but not least, you can also physically locate a workplace, for example with an office room. With the [`**Floor Plan**`](/display/de/Floorplan) add-on you can then even visualize this room.

Relocation of a Workplace
-------------------------

Should a person change the room within the company, you can manage the relocation of the workplace and selected workplace components. The `**[Relocate CI](/display/en/Relocate-CI)**` add-on offers a function solution for a relocation.
