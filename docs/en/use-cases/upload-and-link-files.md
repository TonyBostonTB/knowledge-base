A complete IT documentation often includes documents in form of files. Whether you have operating manuals, emergency plans, contracts, installation protocols or drivers - important files should be linked to [objects](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) in i-doit.

Files are Objects
-----------------

Each uploaded file in i-doit is automatically an object. The advantage of this is that you can assign any [categories and attributes](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) to these files and you can [link](/display/en/Object+Relations) them to any other object. The standard setup of i-doit already supplies the matching [object types](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md):

*   `**Files**` and
*   `**Emergency plan**`.

These can be extended by other [custom object types](/display/en/Custom+Object+Types), for example for operating manuals.

You can find the actual function (upload, link etc.) in the `**Files**` [category folder](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md). The folder has the following sub-categories:

*   `**Current file**`: Information about the uploaded file, download option and categorization of the file
*   `**File versions**`: Each file can have any number of versions. Each new upload of the file generates a new version.
*   `**Assigned objects**`: Which objects are assigned to this file? (only view, no function)

The  `**Files**` category folder belongs to the [specific categories](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md), which can be assigned to any desired object types with help of the [object type configuration](/display/en/Custom+Object+Types).

In various [mirrored categories](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) you can link file objects and other objects:

*   File assignment
*   User manual assignment
*   Emergency plan assignment

You can assign these [global categories](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) to [any object types](/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61014294) and they have similar functions, namely the assignment of files.

Upload of files and link with objects
-------------------------------------

There are two ways to upload a file: Either you create a new object of the type `**Files**` and then upload the file in the `**File versions**` category or you use the `**File assignment**` category and take the object which is to be linked to the file.

For fiiles which are uploaded with the file assignment category, i-doit automatically creates an object. So you can save a few clicks.

The attribute for **`File assignment (object)`** is rather flexible:

*   With drag and drop you can move a file from the desktop etc. into the attribute field.
*   Per auto-complete you can assign already uploaded files.
*   With a click on the magnifier icon the `**File browser**` opens with which you can select and upload the file.

The `**File browser**` lists all available files. You can sort the files with the `**Category**` attribute so that you have a clearer overview.

Link files in custom categories
-------------------------------

To link a file with an object you aren't dependent on the i-doit default categories. You can add attributes of the field type `**File browser**` to [custom categories](#).

Document Module

If you want to generate user manuals, emergency plans etc. directly from your IT documentation, you should consider the use of the [Documents add-on](/display/en/Documents) for i-doit. With this module you can add [attributes](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md), images and [reports](/display/en/Report+Manager) from i-doit to comprehensive text documents.
