Selection of Objects and the Category to be Edited
--------------------------------------------------

When you activate the list editing using the `**Extras**`  menu, you can select the objects you wish to edit in the next step. You can also choose the [category](/display/en/Glossary) you want to edit. Additionally, you can define a filter to limit the shown entries to a specific selection. For example, you can display only software assignments of a specific software.

Execution of the List Editing
-----------------------------

As soon as the objects and the category have been selected, the list editing will load. You will receive a list of objects, including the properties of the selected category. Each line represents a single object.  
Changes within a line of an object just change the [attribute](/display/en/Glossary) of the object. Changes in the uppermost line assign the same value to all objects in the selected attribute. These changes are applied as soon as you click the `**Save**` button.The placeholder **##COUNT##** allows for an automated sequential numbering of the data records. It is also possible to let the numbering start from a specific value and to determine the leading zeros. Examples for this are available in the bottom section of the list editing.A counter will show you the number of applied changes.
