Before running [`push`](/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75989126) or [`pull`](/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75989124) you like to take a deeper look how your infrastructure looks like in both tools i-doit and checkmk. The commands [`fetch-objects` and `fetch-hosts`](/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75989116) gives you detailed information about your documented objects in i-doit or your monitored hosts in checkmk. But both donâ€™t match them against each other. This is done by the command `match`:

`idoitcmk match`

After comparing each object with each host some detailed reports will be printed:

*   Objects in i-doit which can be updated by hosts in checkmk
*   Hosts in checkmk which are not available as objects in i-doit
*   Hosts in checkmk which can be updated by objects in i-doit
*   Objects in i-doit which are not available as hosts in checkmk

None of your data will be altered.

If you increase verbosity this command will give you hints what to do next:
