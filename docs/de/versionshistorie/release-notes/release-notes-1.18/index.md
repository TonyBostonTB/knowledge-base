We're happy to announce that the latest major version 1.18 of i-doit has been released. This update contains a lot of bug fixes, which can be found in the [changelog](/display/de/Changelog+1.18) and new features which have been highly requested by our customers.

You should [update](/display/de/Update+einspielen) to the latest version to benefit from these changes.

Highlights in this release
--------------------------

*   New **crypto hashing** for user passwords to **increase security**.
*   A **configuration** for your own **[custom counter-placeholders](https://kb.i-doit.com/display/de/CMDB+Einstellungen#CMDBEinstellungen-BenutzerdefinierteZ%C3%A4hler)** to gain control over multiple different counters at the same time.
*   Two **Dialog+ fields** in custom categories can now be **linked with a dependency**, so you will have different selections of values, based on the first picked value.
